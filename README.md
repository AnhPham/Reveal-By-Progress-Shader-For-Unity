<h1>Reveal By Progress Shader for Unity</h1>

Reveal By Progress Shader is a custom shader that reveals an object based on a progress value. It features a clear boundary effect with a customizable color, separating the revealed area from the hidden area. Hidden sections can be filled with a specific color, and the effect is determined by the objectâ€™s Y-coordinate. Additional properties such as smoothness, metallic appearance, and boundary thickness allow for flexible customization.
